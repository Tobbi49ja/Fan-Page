              Juice WRLD (real name: Jarad Anthony Higgins) was an American
              rapper, singer, and songwriter born on December 2, 1998, in
              Chicago, Illinois. He rose to fame with his breakout hit "Lucid
              Dreams" in 2018, which sampled Sting's "Shape of My Heart" and
              peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.
              <br /><br /><br />
              Juice WRLD was known for his emo-rap style, blending hip-hop with
              themes of heartbreak, mental health, and drug use. His music often
              featured freestyles and emotionally raw lyrics that resonated with
              a younger generation. Other popular tracks include "All Girls Are
              the Same," "Robbery," "Legends," and "Wishing Well."
              <br /><br /><br />
              Tragically, he passed away on December 8, 2019, at just 21 years
              old, after suffering a seizure at Chicago's Midway Airport,
              reportedly due to an accidental drug overdose. Despite his short
              life, Juice WRLD left a major impact on the music world and is
              remembered as one of the leading voices of a new wave of
              genre-blending artists. His posthumous albums, including "Legends
              Never Die" (2020), have continued to find success.

              singer, and songwriter known for his emotionally raw lyrics and
              genre-blending style that fused hip-hop, rock, and emo influences.
              He rose to fame in 2018 with his breakout single “Lucid Dreams,”

              <br />
              His debut album, Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), showcased his
